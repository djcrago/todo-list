There is a lot I learned in the course of this project.

* I practiced using webpack to build my largest project so far.
* I practiced using import and export to organize my code into modules.
* I practiced seperating the base logic of my app running behind the scenes (got everything working in the console first) from the dom logic which simply displayed the base information.
* I practiced SOLID programming to the best of my abilities.
* I practiced expanding other modules.
* I refactored my code when my initial design didn't work as I begin to add more functionality.
* I used localStorage for the first time and encountered its errors concerning a circular structure.
* I was also reminded the important of starting with pen and paper, as this project ended up taking me (I estimate) twice as long as it might have because I spent so much time fixing and reworking my code.
